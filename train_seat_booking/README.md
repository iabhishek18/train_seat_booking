# Train Seat Booking System

This project is a train seat booking system that includes both frontend and backend components.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Contains the user interface of the train seat booking system.
- **Backend**: Handles the server-side operations and manages the booking system's logic, API calls, and database interactions.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following software is installed on your system before proceeding:

- **Node.js**: For running the backend (Download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/)).
- **NPM**: Comes with Node.js installation, used for managing dependencies.

## Steps to Run

### Backend Setup

1. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd train_seat_booking/backend
   ```

2. Install the necessary packages by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server by running:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The backend is deployed at [https://train-booking-2.onrender.com](https://train-booking-2.onrender.com).

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd train_seat_booking/frontend
   ```

2. Start the frontend server:

   - If it's a simple HTML file, you can open the file directly in your browser, or:
   - If you're using a frontend framework (like React, Angular, etc.), follow the respective steps to start the frontend server (e.g., `npm start` if React is used).

   The frontend is also deployed at [https://trains-seat-booking.netlify.app/](https://trains-seat-booking.netlify.app/).

## Notes

- Ensure that the backend server is running before starting the frontend so that the APIs can be accessed properly.
- Both servers need to be run in parallel for the system to work end-to-end.
